## Grammar
### Role Playing
-  Lesson Goal:Before studying the grammar rules explicitly, students will naturally acquire and understand grammar through example-based conversations.

- Lesson Description:
This conversation-focused class helps students acquire and use specific grammar structures through real-life English dialogues. Learners use a Python-based app to input a target grammar point, generate a dialogue containing that grammar, and then roleplay the conversation in pairs or small groups. This method improves both speaking fluency and grammatical accuracy.
   Advantages
  1. Grammar becomes "living knowledge" by using it in authentic dialogue situations instead of textbook examples.
  2. Repeating grammar in a natural context enhances speaking fluency and confidence.
  3. Pair and group activities promote communication skills, listening, and social development.

  Disadvantages
  1. Students lacking basic grammar knowledge may need additional explanations before engaging in roleplays.
  2. Speaking alone may not fully internalize grammar forms and rules—supplementary learning is required.
  3. Introverted or low-confidence students may be reluctant to participate in roleplays.


## Passage Reading

"In the small town of Willowby, there stood an old library *that was rumored* to be enchanted. Every night at midnight, the books inside would whisper stories to each other, bringing their characters to life. One evening, Sarah, a curious 15-year-old book lover, decided to sneak into the library to see if the rumors were true.
As the clock struck twelve, the books began to rustle. To Sarah's amazement, characters stepped out of their pages. She met Alice from Wonderland, the White Rabbit, and even pirates from Treasure Island. They invited her to join their midnight council, where they discussed the tales of their adventures and the wisdom they contained.
Sarah spent the whole night listening and learning from the characters, promising to keep their secret. *As* dawn approached, they returned to their pages. Sarah left the library, inspired and filled with stories to tell, forever changed by the magic of the Midnight Library."
