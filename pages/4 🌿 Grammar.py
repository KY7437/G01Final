        Be verb plus participle<br>
        In this section, we will take a look about the passives.<br><br>
        When we use an <strong>active verb</strong>, we say <strong>what the subject does</strong>: <br>
        - My grandfather was a builder. He built this house in 1981.<br>
        - It‚Äôs a big company. It employs two hundred people.<br><br>
        When we use a <strong>passive verb</strong>, we say <strong>what happens to the subject</strong>:<br>
        - ‚ÄòHow old is this house?‚Äô ‚ÄòIt was built in 1981.‚Äô<br>
        - Two hundred people are employed by the company.<br><br>
        When we use the passive, who or what causes the action is often unknown or unimportant:<br>
        - A lot of money was stolen in the robbery. (somebody stole it, but we don‚Äôt know who)<br>
        - Is this room cleaned every day? (does somebody clean it? ‚Äì it‚Äôs not important who)<br><br>
        If we want to say who does or what causes the action, we use <strong>by</strong>:<br>
        - This house was built <strong>by my grandfather</strong>.<br>
        - Two hundred people are employed <strong>by the company</strong>.<br><br>
        The passive is be (is/was etc.) + past participle (done/cleaned/seen etc.):<br>
        (be) done (be) cleaned (be) damaged (be) built (be) seen etc.<br><br>
        The past participle often ends in -ed (cleaned/damaged etc.), but many important verbs are irregular (built/done/stolen etc.). To practice irregular forms more, go to Voca Starter and use the app deployed on tab 3.
